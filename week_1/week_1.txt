Intro
=======

NP-Complete: 
- Can check if solution quickly, i.e. in polynomial time
- IF we can solve one NP-complete quickly, we can solve them all
- Widely believed to take exponential time

Power Restoration Problem
- Reducing the time to restore a black out

Philosopy
=======

- Constraint Programming
- Local Search
- Integer Programming

Assignment: One NP-Hard problem a week and optimize it

15 hours a week
1 to 3 of lectures, 12-14 hours of coding
